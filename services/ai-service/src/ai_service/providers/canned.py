"""A provider that answers from a script, for demonstrating the service with
no credential and no network.

This exists because a live demo depends on someone else's API being up and on
the room's wifi. It is a rehearsal and fallback path, not a test double —
tests use FakeProvider.

Answers are shaped like real ones so the response is readable, and are marked
as canned in three places that travel with them: the attribution the caller
receives, the proposed title, and the justification. An earlier version
prefixed every field with a banner, which made the output unreadable and hid
the thing a demo is trying to show.
